1920,BeauHD,NASAs Cassini probe has captured news images of Saturns rings in unprecedented detail  The images were captured by the probe in its penultimate mission phase of its mission that includes 20 orbits that dive past the outer edge of the main ring system before the spacecraft plunges into the planet itself Interestingly the rings include what NASA calls moonlets  embedded in them VOA News reports The images are the closest ever taken of Saturns rings and according to NASA  oeresolve details as small as 550 meters which is on the scale of Earths tallest buildings  Theringgrazing orbits began last November and will continue until the end of April and in addition to spotting the moonlets they have given greater clarity to other structures within the rings such as the socalled propellerlike formations NASA added that Cassini has also provided the closestever glimpses of two small moons Daphnis and Pandora The report via NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL adds Some of the structures seen in recent Cassini images have not been visible at this level of detail since the spacecraft arrived at Saturn in mid2004 At that time fine details like straw and propellers  which are caused by clumping ring particles and small embedded moonlets respectively  had never been seen before Although propellers were present in Cassinis arrival images they were actually discovered in later analysis the following year Cassini came a bit closer to the rings during its arrival at Saturn but the quality of those arrival images examples 1  2  3  was not as high as in the new views Those precious few observations only looked out on the backlit side of the rings and the team chose short exposure times to minimize smearing due to Cassinis fast motion as it vaulted over the ring plane This resulted in images that were scientifically stunning but somewhat dark and noisy,"[u'space', u'technology', u'communications', u'nasa', u'moon', u'science', u'saturn']",{},0

1504,BeauHD,In October 2015 two gamers who used facescanning tech found in 2K Games NBA series to create more realistic avatars filed a lawsuit against the company as they were concerned about how 2K would store and use their biometric data On Monday however a New York federal judge ruled that neither games biometric face scanning tech had established sufficient injury to the plaintiffs  implying that their concerns over privacy were unfounded Engadget reports Using your consoles camera the company employs facescanning tech in its popular NBA series with both 2Ks NBA 2K16 and 2K15 using the data to help players create more accurate avatars In order to use the tech players must first agree to 2Ks terms and conditions consenting that after scanning them their face may be made visible to others While the plaintiffs agreed to the publishers terms the court case arose because the gamers claimed that 2K never made clear made clear that scans would be stored indefinitely and biometric data could be shared With little evidence to suggest how their privacy would be at risk the judge gave 2K the benefit of the doubt  Still no matter the outcome its a landmark case with biometric data sure to play an increasingly important role in identifying individuals in the future While there is certainly nothing that suggests that 2K will use the data for nefarious means the result of this case does raise some interesting questions about who owns the right to your digital likeness,"[u'yro', u'privacy', u'games', u'court', u'entertainment', u'security', u'biology', u'lawsuit']","{899105: [2], 832646: [2], 4811527: [1], 2047080: [2], 756137: [2], 674572: [3], 62254: [2], 557649: [2], 166417: [2], 2726007: [3], 666: [0, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 2, -1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], 91802: [2]}",39

1529,BeauHD,Tufts University professor and founder of Ionic Materials  Mike Zimmerman hopes that his resilient ionic battery technology will finally replace Lithium Ion The reason scientists and researchers pay so much attention to battery design is because todays lithiumion technologies have several downsides as we saw recently with Samsungs Galaxy Note 7 recall If you were to take apart a lithiumion battery youd find a positive electrode called the anode and a negatively charged electrode called the cathode Theres a thin separator that sits between the anode and cathode Everything else is filled up with liquid or electrolyte Charging the battery causes positively charged ions to flow through the liquid from the negative side to the positive side As you use the battery the ions flow in the opposite direction However the electrolyte is extremely flammable and they can explode when pierced or overheated Zimmermans ionic battery trades the flammable liquid for a piece of plastic film to serve as the electrolyte  It isnt prone to overheating and catching fire The same goes for piercing cutting or otherwise destroying the battery Also unlike lithiumion batteries Zimmermans ionic batteries use actual lithiummetal which can store twice as much power Lithiumion batteries dont contain lithiummetal because theyre even more prone to overheating and exploding than lithiumion but that risk is removed by Zimmerman swapping out the liquid electrolyte for a solid Further reading Yahoo News,"[u'hardware', u'power', u'devices', u'battery', u'lithium']","{15680: [2, 2], 1120555: [2], 11270: [2], 1170183: [1], 1198475: [2], 934156: [5], 937105: [2], 537106: [1], 1900440: [3, 1], 666: [0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 874524: [2, 2], 883997: [3], 1663783: [2], 1134087: [3], 971949: [2, 2], 622387: [2], 2295862: [2, 2], 95548: [2, 2, 2, 2, 3], 2326718: [5], 17472: [2], 2244: [2], 674572: [3], 783565: [2], 729550: [2], 567632: [2], 977108: [2], 2752469: [5], 604125: [5], 589790: [2, 2], 64226: [2], 982372: [2], 68843: [2], 4446709: [2]}",65
2109,BeauHD,Halfway through the Brains vs AI poker competition it was pretty clear the artificial intelligence named Libratus would end up victorious against its human opponents who are four of the worlds top professional players Lo and behold Libratus lived up to its balanced and forceful Latin name by becoming the first AI to beat professional poker players at headsup nolimit Texas Holdem  reports IEEE Spectrum From the report The tournament was held at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh from 1130 January Developed by Carnegie Mellon University the AI won the  Brains Vs Artificial Intelligence tournament against four poker pros by 1766250 in chips over 120000 hands games Researchers can now say that the victory margin was large enough to count as a statistically significant win meaning that they could be at least 997 percent sure that the AI victory was not due to chance Previous attempts to develop pokerplaying AI that can exploit the mistakes of opponents  whether AI or human  have generally not been overly successful says Tuomas Sandholm  a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University Libratus instead focuses on improving its own play which he describes as safer and more reliable compared to the riskier approach of trying to exploit opponent mistakes Even more importantly the victory demonstrates how AI has likely surpassed the best humans at doing strategic reasoning in imperfect information games such as poker The nolimit Texas Holdem version of poker is a good example of an imperfect information game because players must deal with the uncertainty of two hidden cards and unrestricted bet sizes An AI that performs well at nolimit Texas Holdem could also potentially tackle realworld problems with similar levels of uncertainty In other words the Libratus algorithms can take the rules of any imperfectinformation game or scenario and then come up with its own strategy The Libratus victory comes two years after a first Brains Vs Artificial Intelligence competition held at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh in AprilMay 2015,"[u'technology', u'software', u'games', u'money', u'entertainment', u'ai', u'gambling', u'poker']","{1162755: [3], 1264518: [2], 1134087: [3, 4, 2], 934156: [2], 819476: [2, 2], 666: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 1177377: [2], 1748130: [2], 1443: [2], 832646: [2], 2968043: [2], 135727: [2], 1411889: [2, 2, 2, 2], 1204146: [2], 1179573: [4], 4772409: [2], 3732157: [2], 1266624: [2], 2484676: [3, 5], 889928: [2], 88907: [2, 2, 4, 2, 2], 112972: [2], 729550: [2], 4145623: [2], 30937: [2], 928602: [2], 1262684: [2], 148191: [2], 1536101: [2, 2, 2, 2], 907627: [1], 319597: [2], 25149: [3], 640240: [3], 4446709: [4], 412918: [2, 2, 2], 9335: [2, 2], 990842: [1], 598654: [1]}",84

2115,BeauHD,schwit1 shares with us a report on a 11part series led by The Intercept reporter Cora Currier Secret FBI rules allow agents to obtain journalists phone records with approval from two internal officials  far less oversight than under normal judicial procedures The classified rules dating from 2013 govern the FBIs use of national security letters which allow the bureau to obtain information about journalists calls without going to a judge or informing the news organization being targeted They have previously been released only in heavily redacted form  Media advocates said the documents show that the FBI imposes few constraints on itself when it bypasses the requirement to go to court and obtain subpoenas or search warrants before accessing journalists information The rules stipulate that obtaining a journalists records with a national security letter requires the signoff of the FBIs general counsel and the executive assistant director of the bureaus National Security Branch  in addition to the regular chain of approval Generally speaking there are a variety of FBI officials including the agents in charge of field offices who can sign off that an NSL is relevant to a national security investigation There is an extra step under the rules if the NSL targets a journalist in order to identify confidential news media sources In that case the general counsel and the executive assistant director must first consult with the assistant attorney general for the Justice Departments National Security Division But if the NSL is trying to identify a leaker by targeting the records of the potential source and not the journalist the Justice Department doesnt need to be involved The guidelines also specify that the extra oversight layers do not apply if the journalist is believed to be a spy or is part of a news organization associated with a foreign intelligence service or otherwise acting on behalf of a foreign power Unless again the purpose is to identify a leak in which case the general counsel and executive assistant director must approve the request,"[u'yro', u'privacy', u'court', u'internet', u'government', u'communications', u'usa', u'security', u'politics', u'media', u'fbi']","{795499: [5], 1673220: [1, 1, 1, 2], 1853064: [2], 748553: [5], 461968: [1], 658967: [2], 666: [4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2], 1860506: [2], 265889: [2], 837924: [0], 892839: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 1460385: [2, 5], 1050414: [2, 1, 2, 2], 662832: [2], 701233: [2, 2, 2], 4394035: [2, 2, 2], 4772409: [2, -2, 2], 688445: [2, 2], 1266624: [3], 969671: [2, 2], 197448: [1, 2, 2], 783565: [2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2], 559311: [2], 462034: [2], 60756: [3], 462549: [2, -2, 2, 2], 4145623: [2], 1383: [2], 2777323: [2], 4855919: [0], 2009072: [3, 2, 2], 1678196: [3], 2726007: [2], 761081: [3], 3412475: [5], 679165: [1, 1, 1, 1]}",105

3221,BeauHD,Lysergic acid diethylamide LSD has been credited in part for the creation of the iPhone  the polymerase chain reaction  as well as some pretty abstract artwork  Since the drug is classified as a Schedule 1 substance in the US its been more difficult for scientists to legally study the drug and learn about how it affects the brain Therefore when a study or two is published it makes the findings all the more fascinating Two studies were published last week one in Current Biology  the other in Cell  that examine how LSD produces such diverse effects and why the drug takes so long to wear off The Scientist reports the findings from for the first study For the Current Biology study 21 volunteers were given a placebo a small dose of LSD alone or the same dose of LSD but with kentaserin a serotonin 2A antagonist Study participants who took the kentaserin reported virtually the same experiences as those who took the placebo and fMRI brain scans confirmed similar brain activities across participants in both groups  The serotonin 2A antagonist blocked all the effects of LSD so it was like if people didnt take any drugs coauthor Katrin Preller neuroscientist at the Zurich University Hospital in Switzerland told The Verge  All the typical symptoms  hallucinations everything  were gone As for why an LSD high lasts for so long Angus Chen has written an indepth report on PBS Newshour about the findings from the study published in Cell LSD and other psychoactive drugs work by binding to specialized proteins called receptors on the surfaces of neural cells On the receptor protein is a sculpted pocket into which molecules with the right shape can fit and thus stick to the cell where they initiate changes in the brain But different substances can often fit into the same receptor Many receptors that bind LSD and DMT for example also fit the natural chemical messenger serotonin  which is produced in the body and helps regulate mood Figuring out how each drug interacts with the same receptor in a different way is key to understanding why an LSD trip lasts all day whereas an experience with extracted DMT is often over in 15 minutes or less By freezing an LSD molecule bound to a single brain cell receptor as a crystal in a lab researchers were able to get a 3D xray image of the drug and the protein locked together The image showed Bryan Rother a pharmacologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and senior author on the paper and his coauthors something strange about the way LSD fit inside this receptor Drugs typically come and go from receptor proteins like ships pulling in and out of a port But when an LSD molecule lands on the receptor the molecule snags onto a portion of the protein and folds it over itself as the molecule binds to the receptor LSD seems to stimulate the receptor for the entire time it is trapped underneath the protein lid Roth says Proteins are in constant motion so he thinks the lid eventually flops open allowing the drug to fly out and the effects to wear off But the team ran computer models that suggest it could take hours for that to happen Until then the trip goes on,"[u'medicine', u'science', u'biology', u'chemistry', u'acid', u'art']","{1986182: [2], 739463: [2], 789256: [3, 5, 5, 2], 9367: [2], 1290638: [2], 166417: [2, 4, 2], 1955220: [4], 755736: [4, 4], 1195671: [2], 231448: [1], 524825: [2], 666: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, -2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, -2, 0, 0, 0], 627867: [2], 2428506: [5], 4641057: [2], 231845: [2], 2538550: [2, 3], 914487: [2, 2, 2], 716217: [2], 12862: [1], 1980226: [5], 1812804: [1, -2], 14022: [2, 2], 858439: [5, 3], 207180: [3, 2, 2, 2, 2], 567632: [1], 151122: [2], 172628: [1], 4848953: [1, -2], 254554: [2, 2, 2, 5], 3618909: [2], 579555: [4, 2], 685672: [1], 535155: [2], 867445: [2], 542327: [1, 1, -2, 1], 168184: [2, 5], 2483988: [2, 2, 2, 5]}",105

1481,BeauHD,Astronomers have measured the universes current expansion rate a value known as the Hubble constant  at about 447 miles 719 kilometers per second per megaparsec 326 million lightyears This is consistent with a calculation that was announced last year by a research team but its considerably higher than the rate that was estimated by the European Space Agencys Planck satellite mission in 2015  about 416 miles 669 km per second per megaparsec The cause of this discrepancy is unclear The expansion rate of the universe is now starting to be measured in different ways with such high precision that actual discrepancies may possibly point towards new physics beyond our current knowledge of the universe a researcher said Mike Wall writes via Spacecom The differences in the Hubble constant estimates may reflect something that astronomers dont understand about the early universe or something that has changed since that longago epoch scientists have said For example its possible that dark energy  the mysterious force thats thought to be driving the universes accelerating expansion  has grown in strength over the eons members of Riess team said last year The discrepancy could also indicate that dark matter  the strange invisible stuff that astronomers think vastly outweighs normal matter throughout the universe  has asyetunappreciated characteristics or that Einsteins theory of gravity has some holes they added,"[u'space', u'earth', u'technology', u'science', u'math']","{1206400: [5], 2370816: [4, 2, 5], 982402: [2, -2], 1625475: [2, 2, 2, 2], 11270: [3], 1414919: [2], 2201864: [2, 0], 4702349: [1], 1829006: [2, 2, 2, -2, -2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], 1231380: [2, 2], 630808: [2], 666: [2, -2, 1, -2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2, -2, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, -2, 0], 1175323: [2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 2], 598556: [3], 3135005: [2, 2], 4224287: [1, 1], 701275: [5], 832646: [3, 2, 2], 682162: [2], 743607: [1], 580665: [2], 799651: [2], 917438: [5], 143899: [2, -2], 599362: [2, -2, -2], 458624: [2, -2], 137803: [1], 729550: [4], 236753: [2], 1124179: [3], 830549: [3], 582871: [1], 875483: [2], 321000: [2], 215404: [3], 704621: [2], 214511: [2], 2326718: [5], 4245243: [2]}",114
2461,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica In 1935 scientists predicted that the simplest element hydrogen could also become metallic under pressure and they calculated that it would take 25 GigaPascals to force this transition each Gigapascal is about 10000 atmospheres of pressure That estimate in the words of the people who have finally made metallic hydrogen was way off It took until last year for us to reach pressures where the normal form of hydrogen started breaking down into individual atoms  at 380 GigaPascals Now a pair of Harvard researchers has upped the pressure quite a bit more and they have finally made hydrogen into a metal  All of these highpressure studies rely on what are called diamond anvils This hardware places small samples between two diamonds which are hard enough to stand up to extreme pressure As the diamonds are forced together the pressure keeps going up Current calculations suggested that metallic hydrogen might require just a slight boost in pressure from the earlier work at pressures as low as 400 GigaPascals But the researchers behind the new work Ranga Dias and Isaac Silvera discovered it needed quite a bit more than that In making that discovery they also came to a separate realization normal diamonds werent up to the task Diamond failure they note is the principal limitation for achieving the required pressures to observe SMH where SMH means solid metallic hydrogen rather than shaking my head The team came up with some ideas about what might be causing the diamonds to fail and corrected them One possibility was surface defects so they etched all diamonds down by five microns to eliminate these Another problem may be that hydrogen under pressure could be forced into the diamond itself weakening it So they cooled the hydrogen to slow diffusion and added material to the anvil that absorbed free hydrogen Shining lasers through the diamond seemed to trigger failures so they switched to other sources of light to probe the sample After loading the sample and cranking up the pressure literally  they turned a handcrank they witnessed hydrogens breakdown at high pressure which converted it from a clear sample to a black substance as had been described previously But then somewhere between 465 and 495 GigaPascals the sample turned reflective a key feature of metals The study has been published in the journal Science ,"[u'earth', u'technology', u'science', u'hydrogen', u'chemistry']","{573697: [2], 655250: [5], 27524: [5], 1122693: [3], 544774: [2], 1487879: [3, 5, 2, -2, -2, 2, 2, -2, 5], 925706: [3, -2], 934156: [4], 4278669: [3], 3450605: [2], 740021: [4], 1250194: [4], 173459: [2, 4, 2], 711899: [2], 1860506: [3, 3], 143899: [3, -2, -2], 526365: [3], 129182: [5, 2], 1154723: [2], 842533: [5], 666: [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2], 3395377: [2], 4394035: [4], 9002: [3], 739463: [5, 2, 2, 2], 895663: [5], 14640: [5], 701233: [2, 2, 2, 2], 561202: [5, -2, 5], 622387: [2], 97333: [3, 3], 2814641: [3], 762122: [3, -2], 2538558: [2, 2], 549877: [2, -2], 33222: [2], 2429386: [2], 643147: [4], 581327: [4, 3], 799651: [2, -2], 987991: [5], 243626: [2], 40154: [3, -2, 5], 107611: [2], 1548255: [5], 928602: [2], 664417: [5, -2, 4, -2, 5], 579555: [3, -2], 212196: [5, -2, 5, 2, 3], 990309: [3, -2], 2212710: [5, -2], 91624: [2, 2], 577257: [2, -2], 221419: [5], 215404: [2], 151149: [4, 2], 1897204: [4, -2], 1004414: [3], 2463226: [3], 1343: [5, -2, -2, -2], 638845: [3], 1868030: [2]}",122

1875,BeauHD,In a process that could transform organ transplantation scientists in Japan and the US have reportedly cured mice of diabetes by transplanting mouse cells grown in rats  The study has been published in the journal Nature  Quartz reports To achieve this feat researchers injected mouse pluripotent stem cells into a rat embryo As the name suggests these pluripotent stem cells are able to transform themselves into all types of cells The mouse cells intermingled with rat cells and created a chimera whose organs and tissues were almost all created from a mix of mouse and rat cells Crucially however they had modified the rat to not produce pancreatic cells They achieved this by knocking out a gene called Pdx1 The upshot was that the pancreas in the chimera was almost completely made of mouse cells When the ratmouse chimeras became adults the researchers removed the animals pancreases and from them isolated endocrine islets which contain Bcells that produce insulin The Bcells were then transplanted to diabetic mice that had lost all their native Bcells The mice that received the transplant were put on mild immunosuppressant drugs However the scientists found they only needed to administer the drugs for five days after transplantation Surprisingly the few rat cells that came along during the transplant mostly in the blood vessels in the islets had been destroyed and replaced by the mouses own cells The Bcells in mice that got the transplants functioned just as they would in a healthy mouse for more than a year which was the complete observation period These lab mice only live for two to three years which makes a oneyear observation fairly long The research opens up the door for growing human organs inside say a pig using the patients own stem cells and then transplanting the organ when its mature and ready,"[u'japan', u'usa', u'medicine', u'science', u'genetics', u'cells']","{573697: [2, 1], 4161549: [2, 2], 464142: [1], 68377: [2], 666: [0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0], 695710: [2], 899105: [2], 1513635: [2], 112805: [2], 19622: [2], 4819757: [1], 587954: [2], 3653043: [1], 196126: [1], 951993: [2, 5], 116160: [3], 1208008: [1], 665546: [1], 1033548: [1, 1], 1527631: [2], 212196: [1], 4843879: [1], 3450605: [2], 2526834: [2], 47614: [2], 168184: [2], 789630: [5]}",72

2390,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register Shortly after the American College of Education ACE in Indiana fired IT administrator Triano Williams in April 2016 it found that it no longer had any employees with admin access to the Google email service used by the school  In a lawsuit PDF filed against Williams in July 2016 the school alleges that it asked Williams to return his work laptop which was supposed to have the password saved But when Williams did so in May that year the complaint says the computer was returned wiped with a new operating system and damaged to the point it could no longer be used ACE claimed that its students could not access their Googlehosted ACE email accounts or their online coursework The school appealed to Google but Google at the time refused to help because the ACE administrator account had been linked to Williams personal email address By setting up the administrator account under a nonACE work email address Mr Williams violated ACEs standard protocol with respect to administrator accounts the schools complaint states ACE was unaware that Mr Williams administrator account was not linked to his work address until after his employment ended According to the schools court filing Williams through his attorney said he would help the school reinstate its Google administrator account provided the school paid 200000 to settle his dispute over the termination of his employment That amount is less than half the estimated 500000 in harm the school says it has suffered due to its inability to access its Google account according to a letter from Williams attorney in Illinois Calvita J Frederick Fredericks letter claims that another employee set up the Google account and made Williams an administrator but not the controlling administrator It says the school locked itself out of the admin account through too many failed password attempts Williams in a countersuit PDF filed last month claims his termination followed from a pattern of unlawful discrimination by the school in the wake of a change in management Pointing to the complaint she filed with the court in Illinois Frederick said Williams wrote a letter PDF to a supervisor complaining about the poor race relations at the school and as a result of that letter he was told he had to relocate to Indianapolis,"[u'it', u'technology', u'education', u'software', u'court', u'money', u'os', u'google', u'news', u'lawsuit']","{1383049: [2], 674572: [2, -2, 2], 882574: [3, -2], 182671: [2, -2], 780312: [3], 314770: [5], 4205847: [5], 1241496: [4, 4, 5], 68377: [2, 2, -2], 666: [5, 2, -2, -2, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 2, -2, 5, -2, 5], 191772: [2], 196126: [2, 2, 2], 4374943: [5, -2], 13027: [3], 82978: [2], 2751395: [2, 2, 2, -2], 858022: [2], 701233: [3, 2, 2, 2, -2], 552872: [2], 198444: [2, 2, -2, 2], 150319: [2, 2], 234100: [3, -2], 652467: [2, 2], 212916: [5, 2], 1787294: [2, -2, -2, -2], 555446: [5], 521118: [2], 56372: [5, -2], 39327: [2], 3732157: [2], 2709173: [2], 1856: [2, 2, -2], 629569: [5], 774728: [2, 2, 5], 665546: [4], 525388: [5, -2], 659917: [2, 2], 576507: [2], 168184: [2, -2], 1469267: [2], 635988: [2], 565205: [5], 13307: [2, -2], 630856: [2], 724186: [2], 1036002: [2, -2, 5, -2], 824291: [2, -2, 2, 2, 2], 656740: [2], 15975: [2, -2, 2], 812393: [2, -2, 3], 1203948: [5], 18900: [5], 4839537: [5], 574068: [5], 9205: [5], 33014: [3, 2], 472824: [2, 3, 2], 1678196: [2, -2], 835450: [2], 157947: [5], 78078: [2], 30335: [3]}",127
1787,BeauHD,The latest numbers released by analysts suggest that the Sony PlayStation 4 is selling twice as many units worldwide as the Xbox One since both systems launched in late 2013 The data comes from a new SuperData report on the Nintendo Switch  which is backed up by Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad SuperData mentions an installed base of 26 million Xbox One units and 55 million PS4 units Ars Technica reports Ahmads chart suggests that Microsoft may have sold slightly more than half of the 534 million PS4 units that Sony recently announced it had sold through January 1 Specific numbers aside though its clear Microsoft has done little to close its console sales gap with Sony over the past year  and may have actually lost ground in that time The last time we did our own estimate of worldwide console sales through the end of 2015  we showed the Xbox One with about 57 percent as many systems sold as the PS4 2149 million vs 377 million That lines up broadly with numbers leaked by EA at the time  which suggest the Xbox One had sold about 529 percent as well as the PS4 19 million vs 359 million One year later that ratio has dipped to just above or even a bit below 50 percent according to these reports The relative sales performance of the Xbox One and PS4 doesnt say anything direct about the health or quality of those platforms of course Microsoft doesnt seem to be in any danger of abandoning the Xbox One platform any time soon and has in fact recently committed to upgrading it via Project Scorpio later this year The gap between PS4 and Xbox One sales becomes important only if it becomes so big that publishers start to consider the Xbox One market as a minor afterthought that can be safely ignored for everything but niche games,"[u'microsoft', u'software', u'games', u'money', u'playstation', u'sony', u'nintendo', u'hardware', u'technology', u'xbox', u'entertainment']","{1693318: [5], 1200013: [1], 1143981: [2], 207121: [1, 1], 655250: [2, 2], 666: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 531612: [2], 265505: [3], 135330: [2], 1513635: [2], 1058596: [3, 2, 3, 3], 948389: [2], 123932: [2], 198444: [2], 837043: [1], 126579: [2, 2, 2], 1179573: [2, 2, -2], 4772409: [2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2], 25149: [3], 946632: [2], 1725132: [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], 305362: [2], 1847922: [1], 724186: [2], 350: [4, -2, -2], 869638: [2, -2, -2, 2], 4796689: [2, 1], 1059688: [2], 4015209: [2, -2], 2423402: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], 1704434: [3, 2], 727027: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 184564: [1], 4778741: [0], 2648297: [2, 2, -2], 41083: [2], 926717: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2], 30335: [2]}",107

2860,BeauHD,According to a new Stanford study published in the journal Nature Medicine  caffeine may help to counter the inflammatory process that occurs in some older people  The researchers have found a connection between advancing age systemic inflammation cardiovascular disease and coffee consumption by analyzing blood samples survey data and medical and family histories obtained from more than 100 human participants in a multiyear study Stanford Medical Center Report adds The study implicates this inflammatory process as a driver of cardiovascular disease and increased rates of mortality overall Metabolites or breakdown products of nucleic acids  the molecules that serve as building blocks for our genes  circulating in the blood can trigger this inflammatory process the study found The study also provides evidence that caffeine and its own metabolites may counter the action of these circulating nucleicacid metabolites possibly explaining why coffee drinkers tend to live longer than abstainers Notably this inflammatory mechanism was found to be activated only in some but not all of the older study participants Those in whom it was relatively quiescent tended to drink more caffeinated beverages Laboratory experiments revealed that the mechanism was directly countered by caffeine and associated compounds For the new study the researchers compared blood drawn from older versus younger study participants to see which genes tended to be more highly activated in older people They zeroed in on two clusters of genes whose activity was associated with the production of a potent circulating inflammatory protein called IL1beta The genes within each cluster appeared to work in coordination with one another The researchers found that incubating a type of immune cell with two of those nucleicacid metabolites boosted activity in one of the gene clusters resulting in increased IL1beta production When injected into mice the substances triggered massive systemic inflammation along with high blood pressure In addition immune cells infiltrated and clogged the animals kidneys increasing renal pressure substantially Intrigued by the correlation between older participants health genecluster activation and selfreported rates of caffeine consumption the researchers followed up and verified that blood from the group with low cluster activity was enriched for caffeine and a number of its metabolites compared with blood from the group with high cluster activity Examples of these metabolites are theophylline also found in tea and theobromine which abounds in chocolate Incubating immune cells with caffeine and its breakdown products along with the inflammationtriggering nucleic acid metabolites substantially prevented the latter from exerting their powerful inflammatory effect on the cells,"[u'technology', u'medicine', u'science', u'food', u'health', u'caffeine']","{551297: [2], 1829006: [2], 8978: [2, 2], 1955220: [5, 2], 2923353: [2], 1705114: [1], 4610715: [1, 1, 1], 666: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0], 3678879: [2], 3872: [3, 5, 4, 2], 875483: [2], 20136: [5, 2], 1040042: [5], 366380: [2], 1143981: [2, 3], 305328: [5], 2709173: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 752185: [5, 2, 3, 5], 831835: [1], 722110: [2], 674934: [3], 1469267: [2], 858324: [2, 1], 1290638: [2], 582871: [3], 1546585: [2], 2428506: [5], 970587: [2], 133725: [2], 3740005: [1], 1536101: [2], 91624: [2, 2, 3], 534252: [2], 95088: [2, 1], 959602: [2], 33014: [2, 5, 2], 168184: [2, 2], 4523641: [1], 679165: [1, 1], 650750: [3], 888959: [2]}",99

2174,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica As part of the process to gain federal approval for the simultaneous landing of its Falcon Heavy rocket boosters in Florida SpaceX has prepared an environmental assessment of the construction of two additional landing pads alongside its existing site  The report considers noise and other effects from landing up to three first stages at the same time After undergoing a preliminary review by the US Air Force the document has been released for public comment  As part of the document SpaceX also says it would like to build a Dragon capsule processing facility on the landing zone to support refurbishment of the Dragon 2 spacecraft designed to carry crew into orbit The 130footlong facility would provide a temporary facility for vehicle propellant load and propulsion system servicing When it originally designed its Landing Zone 1 facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for the single Falcon 9 first stage booster the company envisioned the need for one main pad approximately 200 feet across and four smaller contingency pads each approximately 150 feet in diameter The chosen site had enough acreage to accommodate all five pads Improvements in the rockets landing navigation guidance system obviated the need for the contingency pads with the Falcon 9 however So now the company wants to use the additional space to construct two concrete landing pads each with an approximate diameter of 282 feet surrounded by an approximate 50footwide hardpacked soil apron This would give SpaceX three landing pads and the ability to bring back all three Falcon Heavy boosters to land while also retaining the option to land one or two on drone ships in the Atlantic Ocean In addition to the potential for a dozen Falcon 9 launches and landings each year the document says SpaceX may eventually make six Falcon Heavy launches a year potentially returning an additional 18 boosters to the Floridabased site The new pads and crane sites would be configured to allow parallel processing of landed boosters With US Air Force Approval construction could begin as early as this spring,"[u'space', u'business', u'earth', u'usa', u'technology', u'transportation', u'science', u'rocket']","{775424: [3], 512897: [2], 768263: [2], 925706: [2], 234763: [2, 2], 4507405: [-1], 173966: [5, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2], 589967: [2], 566160: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 631190: [2, 2, 2], 666: [0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 2, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2, 0, 0, -1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 2, -1, 0], 739463: [5], 129182: [2], 3872: [2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 5, 2, 2, 3], 1154723: [1, 2, 2], 598059: [2], 19885: [2], 2202674: [2, 2, 2], 4835001: [1], 1912634: [5], 877834: [3], 1266624: [2], 555040: [2], 412356: [2], 957785: [2], 724186: [2], 1155547: [2], 517087: [2], 4333: [2], 806385: [2], 611187: [1], 15477: [2, 2], 33014: [2], 112247: [3], 2627577: [2, 2, 2, 2]}",100

2823,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard On December 30 the White House quietly released its NearEarth Object Preparedness Strategy  a 25page document outlining the United States plans in the event that a giant asteroid is found to be on a collision course with Earth Among the priorities outlined by the strategy are improving NearEarth Object NEO detection developing methods for deflecting asteroids and developing interagency emergency procedures in the event of an NEO impact  Given the stakes its clear why NASA and the leading US defense and research agencies came together in January 2016 to form the Detecting and Mitigating the Impact of Earthbound NearEarth Objects DAMIEN working group to address the issues associated with killer asteroids The DAMIEN group is behind the White Houses new NEO strategy and will be responsible for hashing out the specifics of the plan to save Earthlings from killer asteroids going forward To assist in the search the DAMIEN report calls for a spacebased observatory dedicated to finding NEOs which will work in cooperation with groundbased observatories Since a telescope in space isnt limited by terrestrial weather conditions it would greatly enhance Spaceguards search capacity The only plans currently underway for a spacebased NEO telescope are being carried out by the nonprofit B612 foundation whose Sentinel telescope was supposed to launch last December  but has been delayed due to difficulties securing the requisite 450 million in funding required for the project NASA has also been considering the NEOCam  a spacebased telescope that has received provisional funding for detailed refinement Unfortunately during the latest round of budgeting for NASAs Discovery program two other satellites were greenlit instead of NEOCam but NASA said it would continue the asteroidhunters provisional funding so there is still hope that NASA may go forward with a spacebased NEO observatory in the future especially in light of the recent White House strategy In tandem the report also recommends updating the capabilities of groundbased NEO observatories by endowing them with more powerful planetary radars and improved spectroscopy instruments this would allow for more accurate determinations of the composition of an asteroid But detection is only half the battle In the event that an asteroid is found to be on an impact trajectory with Earth NASA is also thinking about ways to deflect the killer asteroid Some pretty farout ideas have been proposed on this front ranging from nukes in space to giant sunpowered lasers  but the most likely method is simply ramming into the asteroid to change its course Finally should all else fail the report also considers what to do in an impact scenario,"[u'space', u'earth', u'usa', u'technology', u'government', u'nasa', u'science']","{578176: [0], 234881: [2], 652802: [2], 598059: [2, 2], 832646: [2], 551297: [2], 2201864: [3], 798091: [2], 574732: [2], 4036877: [1], 1241496: [5, -2], 1250194: [5], 1625475: [2], 780312: [2], 666: [0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0], 757404: [0], 223005: [5], 801989: [1], 302214: [2], 3506801: [1], 20136: [2], 1040042: [4, 2], 965931: [1], 1280012: [2], 770223: [5], 4475953: [2, 2], 2295862: [2], 312009: [2], 23992: [2], 580665: [4], 965947: [5], 2429386: [2], 179646: [4, -2], 588405: [2], 1809752: [4, -2], 4776131: [5, -2], 992580: [1], 119237: [2, 2, 2], 774728: [2], 1222796: [2], 701642: [2, -2], 2726007: [2], 720718: [2], 2851793: [2, 2, 5], 23507: [2], 907092: [2], 4795349: [1], 153816: [2], 1548255: [2], 749283: [2], 1900244: [4], 1536101: [2, 2], 232550: [1], 41169: [5], 321000: [2, 2], 199273: [2, 2, 2], 624750: [2], 1612783: [1], 2538558: [5], 1793266: [2, 2], 15477: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 3641975: [1, 1, 1], 635988: [2], 70780: [2], 2471722: [2], 1868030: [5], 565205: [3]}",106
1263,BeauHD,schwit1 quotes a report from MIT Technology Review In the southern Indian city of Tuticorin locals are unlikely to suffer from a poorly risen cake Thats because a coalfired thermal power station in the area captures carbon dioxide and turns it into baking soda  Carbon capture schemes are nothing new Typically they use a solvent such as amine to catch carbon dioxide and prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere From there the CO2 can either be stored away or used But the Guardian reports that a system installed in the Tuticorin plant uses a new proprietary solvent developed by the company Carbon Clean Solutions  The solvent is reportedly just slightly more efficient than those used conventionally requiring a little less energy and smaller apparatus to run The collected CO2 is used to create baking soda and it claims that as much as 66000 tons of the gas could be captured at the plant each year Its operators say that the marginal gain in efficiency is just enough to make it feasible to run the plant without a subsidy In fact its claimed to be the first example of an unsubsidized industrial plant capturing CO2 for use schwit1 notes A climate change project that doesnt involve taxpayer dollars Is that even allowed,"[u'earth', u'technology', u'power', u'science', u'carbon']","{652802: [2], 598059: [2, 2], 2584709: [1, 5, 1], 1414919: [3], 550792: [2], 864651: [2], 1222796: [2], 1142669: [2], 173966: [2], 666512: [2], 937105: [3, -2, -2], 548499: [2], 171030: [1], 871886: [5], 1241496: [2, 3, -2, -2, 2, -2, 2], 666: [1, -2, 2, 1, 1, -2, -2], 724186: [2, 2], 1897370: [2], 196126: [5, 2, -2, -2], 648864: [2], 1133985: [2], 862874: [2], 756137: [5, 2], 571051: [2, 5, -2, 4], 366380: [2], 54068: [2], 1787294: [2, -2, -2], 191772: [2], 775369: [2], 112972: [2], 580665: [2], 4481723: [3, 2, 2], 738752: [3], 954982: [5, -2], 412356: [2], 894406: [2, -2, 2, 2], 25929: [2, -2, -2, 2, 2, 3, -2], 2429386: [2, 2, 2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2], 105036: [5, -2, 2], 801382: [4], 720718: [2], 4161549: [2, -2], 1810296: [2], 60756: [3], 463061: [3], 153816: [2, 2], 254554: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 148191: [2], 26595: [2], 44644: [1], 1036902: [4], 2044134: [2], 927697: [3, 2, 2, 2], 1400425: [2, 4], 160668: [3, -2], 534252: [2], 739463: [2], 4150389: [2], 2726007: [2, 3, -2], 803320: [2, -2, 2, 2]}",126
2639,BeauHD,The folks at SiFive have offered Brian Benchoff from Hackaday a look at the HiFive 1  the first handson with the first Open Hardware microcontroller  From the report The design files for the HiFive 1 were made with Altium a proprietary and nonFree software Basically the HiFive 1 is the SiFive FE310 microcontroller packaged in an Arduino Uno form factor The pin spacing is just as stupid as its always been and there is support for a few Adafruit shields sitting around in the SDK There are no analog pins but there are two more PWM pins compared to the standard Arduino chip The Arduino Uno and Leonardo have 32 kilobytes of Flash while the HiFive 1 has sixteen Megabytes of Flash on an external SOIC chip The HiFive 1 supports 33 and 5V IO thanks to three voltage level translators The support for 5V logic is huge in my opinion  nearly every dev board manufacturer has already written off 5V IO as a victim of technological progress The HiFive doesnt even though the FE310 microcontroller is itself only 33V tolerant It should be noted the addition of the voltage level translators add at least a dollar or two to the BOM and double that to the final cost of the board Its a nice touch but theres room for cost cutting here Other than that the only other chip of note on the board is the FTDI FT2232HL a wellsupported but most certainly not Free and Open Source USB to UART chip This is a twoport chip that provides programming serial and debug connections simultaneously The folks at SiFive realize documentation and SDKs are necessary to turn a chip into a development board To that end they have a baremetal SDK and support for the Arduino IDE The board itself comes with a bootloader and when you plug the HiFive 1 into a USB you get the equivalent of the Blink sketch from the Arduino Yes you too can have Open Source blinkies What a magical time to be alive Right now there are two methods of programming the HiFive 1 The Freedom E SDK and the Arduino IDE The Arduino IDE appears to be dependent on the Freedom E SDK so either way youll have to get the SDK running Right now the SDK only works under Linux and OS X and possibly Cygwin but support for Windows is coming For Linux users the getting started guide is more than sufficient although it will take quite a while at least 30 minutes to build all the tools Once the Freedom E SDK is installed support for the Arduino IDE pretty much falls into place Youll have to futz around with the Boards Manager but with a few clicks you get something fantastic You can blink an LED with Open Source Hardware,"[u'hardware', u'technology', u'software', u'opensource', u'news', u'flash', u'sdk']","{8461: [2, 2], 622222: [2, 2, 2], 2874255: [2, 2, 2, 2], 1900440: [2], 666: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 1944222: [2], 753: [5], 1370409: [2], 467244: [2], 4394035: [2, 3], 196126: [2, 2, 2, 2], 623926: [2], 1897204: [2], 1525947: [2], 97333: [2], 592200: [2], 2429386: [2, 2], 1099: [2], 4036877: [2], 851793: [3], 260439: [2], 153816: [5, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2], 1183119: [1, 3, 1, 1, 1], 1410145: [2], 143330: [3], 2212710: [2], 212592: [3], 132337: [2], 1855348: [4], 2726007: [2, 2]}",83

1730,BeauHD,Layzej writes from a report via Ars Technica In 2015 NOAA released version 4 of their marine temperature dataset called ERSST The new dataset accounted for a known cooling bias introduced when ocean temperature measurements transitioned from being taken in ship engine intake valves to buoybased measurements The warming of the last couple decades increased ever so slightly in NOAAs new analysis  This was a red flag for US House Science Committee Chair Lamar Smith RTX who rejects the conclusions of climate science  like the fact that the Earths climate is warming Suddenly he wanted to see the researchers emails and echoed the accusations of contrarian blogs about scientists supposedly nefarious adjustments to sea surface temperature measurements Rather than invoking scientific conspiracies issues like this should be settled by analyzing the data A new study led by University of California Berkeleys Zeke Hausfather does just that  and Rep Smith wont like these results either To test the NOAA dataset Zekes team created instrumentally homogeneous temperature records from sensors available only over the last couple decades   As it happens the Argo float data the buoy data and the satellite data each hew closer to the updated dataset that NOAA used The older version 3b gives a global average that is too cool in recent years growing to an offset of about 006 degrees Celsius The researchers repeat this same analysis for two more major sea surface datasets that are used by the UK Met Office and the Japanese Meteorological Agency for their global temperature records Both of those datasets also drift cooler than the comparison data but less so than NOAAs old dataset,"[u'earth', u'science', u'politics', u'data', u'noaa', u'globalwarming']","{653701: [3, -2, -2, -2, 3, -2, -2, 3, -2, -2, -2, -2], 775178: [5, -2, -2, -2, 3, 2, 3, 5], 1829006: [2, -2, -2, -2, 2, -2, -2, 3, -2, -2], 969998: [2], 1241496: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, -2, 4, 5, -2, 3, -2, 2, 3], 666: [2, 4], 1175323: [5, 5, -2, 4], 874524: [3], 1787294: [3], 4224287: [2, -2, 2], 1855264: [2, -2], 442658: [3], 881307: [3], 1040042: [2], 598059: [4, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2], 135727: [2], 965947: [3, 3], 2673597: [3, 3, 5, -2, 2, 5, 3], 2538558: [2, -2, -2], 961343: [5, -2], 17472: [3], 1048260: [3, -2, 3], 1155781: [3, -2], 664417: [3], 1099: [2, 2, -2, -2, -2, -2], 690786: [2], 179280: [2, 5, 5, 4], 851793: [3], 462034: [2], 1124179: [5, -2, 4, -2, -2, -2], 173966: [5, -2, 5, -2, 5, 5, 3], 762201: [3, -2, 3, -2, -2, 3, 3], 4795349: [2], 699984: [5], 1976930: [5, 3, -2, 3, 3, -2, -2, -2, 5, -2, -2], 97636: [3, 3, -2, 3], 569446: [2], 638312: [3, -2], 704621: [5], 621550: [4, -2, 3], 900691: [2, 4], 549877: [3, -2], 33014: [5, -2, 5, 3], 891256: [3], 621563: [5, 3, 5, -2], 110975: [4, 3]}",162

2960,BeauHD,Qualcomm has detailed the Snapdragon 835 processor  which will power most of the leading Android smartphones this year Its designed to grab information from the air at gigabit speeds and turn it into rich virtual and augmented reality experiences according to several executives at a preCES briefing Qualcomm SVP Keith Kressin said The 835 is going to be one of the key devices that propels the VR use case PC Magazine reports The hardest thing to understand about the Snapdragon 835 especially if youre thinking from a desktop CPU space is how much Qualcomm has been prioritizing elements of the systemonchip other than the CPU This has been coming for years and it can be tricky because it relies on firmware and the Android OS to properly distribute work to nonCPU components of the chip During the briefing it was striking how little Qualcomm talked about its Kryo 280 CPU as compared to other components Qualcomm tries to counter that by pointing out that this is the first 10nm mobile processor which will improve efficiency and also by saying the CPU is tightly integrated with other components using the new Symphony system manager which operates automatically yet can be customized by application developers This distributes work across the CPU GPU DSP and more exotic components letting the Snapdragon 835 work better than it would with CPU alone How that will combine with Qualcomms recent announcement that it will support Windows 10 on mobile PCs including legacy Win32 apps is yet to be seen The Snapdragon 835 consumes 25 percent less power than the 820 according to Qualcomm That means seven hours of 4K streaming video and two hours of VR gaming on a typical device the company said These new uses are really power hungry Since Qualcomm can only do so much on power efficiency its also introducing Quick Charge 4 which supposedly charges a phone to five hours of use in five minutes and is USBC power delivery compliant The new Adreno 540 graphics chip improves 3D performance by 25 percent over the previous generation Qualcomm said But it also enables features like HDR10 which improves colors foveated rendering which most clearly renders what youre looking at rather than elements in the periphery of a scene and low latency which allows you to move your head smoothly around VR scenes With one 32MP or two 16MP cameras running at the same time the Snapdragon 835 supports various dualcamera functions The Snapdragon 835 will feature the X16 modem which Qualcomm announced earlier this year and will be able to boost LTE to gigabit speeds The keys to gigabit LTE are triple 20MHz carrier aggregation with 256QAM encoding and 4x4 MIMO antennas said Qualcomms senior director of marketing Peter Carson Thats going to be first introduced with a Netgear hotspot in Australia this January but Sprint and TMobile have said theyre trying to assemble this set of technologies,"[u'business', u'software', u'communications', u'hardware', u'windows', u'networking', u'technology', u'network', u'os', u'android', u'arm', u'cpu']","{254112: [2], 990842: [2], 666: [0, -1, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 895148: [1], 2429386: [2, 2], 620875: [2], 241452: [2], 803437: [5], 1612783: [1, 1], 97333: [1, 2, 4, 3, 3], 902140: [2], 1179573: [2], 928218: [2, 1, 1], 1175323: [2, 1, 3], 191260: [3], 2515578: [3], 1608317: [1, 1]}",42

2818,BeauHD,An anonymous reader writes from a report via Scientific American Eating beef from an animal infected with mad cow disease can lead to an untreatable condition that attacks the brain and is universally fatal but symptoms can take decades to emerge Thankfully Claudio Soto a neurologist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston and her team as well as a team led by Daisy Bougard of the French Blood Establishment in Montpellier France have developed new bloodscreening technology that can spot Mad Cow Disease known as variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease with 100 percent accuracy  perhaps years before it attacks From the Scientific American Misfolded proteins called prions cause both mad cow and variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease Once they invade the brain they begin recruiting normal proteins and forcing them to adopt the same abnormal shape The prions and the blighted proteins clump together forming increasingly large aggregate deposits that wreak havoc on the brain and invariably lead to death The disease however has a long incubation period In the interim the prions hang out in nonbrain tissues such as the appendix and tonsils and because they do not cause symptoms the infected person becomes a silent carrier The two teams ran the test on blood samples from variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease patients in the UK and France The two teams used slightly different methods but the basic idea was the same the test essentially mimics the progression of the disease in an accelerated artificial environment First the prion proteins are separated from the blood and combined with normal proteins which take on an abnormal shape forming aggregate clumps Then the aggregates are pulled apart and recombined with more normal proteins The process is repeated over and over again in effect replicating the prion proteins until very small quantities are amplified enough to be easily detected If there are no prions present in the blood nothing happens Between the two studies the test was able to identify a total of 32 cases of variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease with 100 percent accuracy and there were no false positives among the 391 controls which included regular blood donors patients with a different form of CreutzfeldtJakob disease and patients with other neurological diseases In addition Bougards group was able to diagnose variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease in the blood of two patients 13 and 26 years before they developed clinical symptoms The two studies   Detection of prions in blood from patients with variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease  and  Detection of prions in the plasma of presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease   were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine,"[u'earth', u'technology', u'medicine', u'science', u'biology', u'disease', u'blood']","{2382592: [1, 1], 797696: [2], 2189826: [2], 1162755: [1], 1149581: [2], 173966: [3, 3], 182671: [3], 173459: [2], 666: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2, -2, 0, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, -2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], 1154723: [2, 2, 5], 243108: [2], 133289: [2], 1040042: [3, 2], 22827: [2], 3528239: [1], 742450: [2], 1643061: [5, 2, 2, 3], 4241347: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 601029: [2], 4332651: [1], 644621: [2], 462549: [2], 153816: [3], 2428506: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 1105119: [2], 720379: [5], 1400425: [2, 2], 2968043: [2], 534252: [2], 704621: [5], 95088: [1], 2613107: [2], 143220: [2], 168184: [3], 1650427: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, -2, 2], 1857066: [2]}",105

1546,,The Nintendo Switch  the hybrid portable games consoletablet due for release in March 2017  will be powered by Nvidias older Tegra X1 SoC and not its upcoming Tegra X2 Parker SoC as initially rumored From a report on ArsTechnica The use of Tegra X1 which also powers the Nvidia Shield Android TV means the graphics hardware inside the Switch is based on Nvidias older secondgeneration Maxwell architecture rather than the latest Pascal architecture While the two architectures share a very similar design the Switch will miss out on some of the smaller performance improvements made in Pascal When docked the Switchs GPU runs at a 768MHz  already lower than the 1GHz of the Shield Android TV When used as a portable the Switch downclocks the GPU to 3072MHz  just 40 percent of the clock speed when docked Given the Switch is highly likely to use a 720p screen rather than 1080p  this is currently assumed to be a 62inch IPS LCD with 10point multitouch support  there is some overhead to run games at 1080p when docked However its questionable how many developers will go to the effort of creating games that make use of the extra horsepower when docked rather than simply opting to program for the slower overall GPU clock speed While GPU performance is variable the rest of the Switchs specs remain static Its four ARM A57 CPU cores are purported to run at 1020MHz regardless of whether the console is docked or undocked while the memory controller can run at either 1600MHz or 1331MHz in either mode,"[u'nintendo', u'games', u'gamers', u'gaming', u'nintendoswitch']","{843271: [2], 1198475: [2, 2, 2], 1222796: [2], 2240530: [1], 2483988: [2], 620565: [2], 2715225: [2], 171801: [2], 666: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 17314: [1], 722855: [2], 4811433: [1], 31985: [3], 971949: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 588974: [2], 682799: [4, 2], 701233: [2], 837043: [1], 1870390: [2], 4641865: [5], 4772409: [1], 205500: [2], 72686: [2], 173002: [3, 2], 120909: [3], 153816: [2], 148697: [2], 820058: [2], 100573: [2], 1176675: [2], 672255: [2], 1400831: [2], 2423402: [2, 3, 2, 2], 67820: [2], 1292526: [3], 723572: [2, 2, 2, 3], 2526834: [2], 2206452: [2], 4650103: [1], 2234232: [2, 2], 634489: [3], 3412475: [2, 2], 30335: [2]}",100

1986,BeauHD,The penis bone can be as long as a finger in a monkey and two feet long in a walrus but the human male has lost it completely According to a new report published in Proceedings of the Royal Society  the lack of a penis bone in human males may be a consequence of monogamy and quick sex  The Guardian reports Known as the baculum to scientists with an interest the penis bone is a marvel of evolution It pops up in mammals and primates around the world but varies so much in terms of length and whether it is present at all that it is described as the most diverse bone ever to exist Prompted by the extraordinary differences in penis bone length found in the animal kingdom scientists set out to reconstruct the evolutionary story of the baculum by tracing its appearance in mammals and primates throughout history They found that the penis bone evolved in mammals more than 95 million years ago and was present in the first primates that emerged about 50 million years ago From that moment on the baculum became larger in some animals and smaller in others Kit Opie who ran the study with Matilda Brindle at University College London said that penis bone length was longer in males that engaged in what he called prolonged intromission In plain English that means that the act of penetration lasts for more than three minutes a strategy that helps the male impregnate the female while keeping her away from competing males The penis bone which attaches at the tip of the penis rather than the base provides structural support for male animals that engage in prolonged intromission Humans may have lost their penis bones when monogamy emerged as the dominant reproductive strategy during the time of Homo erectus about 19 million years ago the scientists believe In monogamous relationships the male does not need to spend a long time penetrating the female because she is not likely to be leapt upon by other amorous males That at least is the theory,"[u'earth', u'medicine', u'science', u'monkeys', u'evolution', u'bones']","{518470: [4, -2, -2], 739463: [5], 113803: [2, 4], 1149581: [5], 601486: [4], 1070040: [2, 3], 1231380: [2], 1241496: [2, 5], 85913: [3], 704538: [2, -2], 1175323: [2, -2, -2], 666: [5, -2, 2], 196126: [3, 5, 2, -2, 2], 3513925: [4, -2], 21281: [2], 221104: [2], 561956: [2, 3, -2], 231845: [2, 2, -2, 3], 19622: [4], 88907: [2], 1040042: [3, 2, -2, -2], 626475: [2], 580652: [3, 2, 2, -2], 1206448: [5], 260657: [2, 2, 2, -2], 535155: [2], 656414: [3, -2], 716217: [2, 2], 2015546: [2], 965947: [2], 326346: [2], 1114677: [2], 641858: [5, -2, 2, -2, 3], 4414539: [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 234436: [2], 645701: [3], 14022: [3], 265505: [5], 216268: [2, 2, -2, 2, 2], 813770: [2, -2, -2], 1153867: [2], 207180: [2, 2, -2, 2, 2, 3], 575309: [2], 618189: [2, -2], 80593: [2, -2], 172628: [3], 3021561: [2], 153816: [2, -2, -2, 2, -2, -2], 1155547: [2], 789413: [3], 664417: [4, 5, 4, 2], 263011: [5], 534886: [2], 232550: [2], 808554: [2], 2968043: [2, 4], 1167213: [2, 2], 583406: [2], 1704434: [2], 575091: [2], 1683700: [2], 2483988: [3], 2463226: [2], 1628283: [3]}",127

1881,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian Emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane have surged in the past decade threatening to thwart global attempts to combat climate change  Scientists have been surprised by the surge which began just over 10 years ago in 2007 and then was boosted even further in 2014 and 2015 Concentrations of methane in the atmosphere over those two years alone rose by more than 20 parts per billion bringing the total to 1830ppb This is a cause for alarm among global warming scientists because emissions of the gas warm the planet by more than 20 times as much as similar volumes of carbon dioxide In the meantime emissions of carbon dioxide  the main component of manmade greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  have been leveling off The new research published in the peerreview journal Environmental Research Letters  suggests that the worlds attempts to control greenhouse gases have failed to take account of the startling rises in methane The authors of the 2016 Global Methane Budget report found that in the early years of this century concentrations of methane rose by only about 05ppb each year compared with 10ppb in 2014 and 2015 The scientists speculate that agriculture may be the main source of the additional methane that has been recorded However they cannot be sure of all the sources owing to a lack of monitoring At least a third of methane comes from the exploitation of fossil fuels including fracking and oil drilling and some coal mining where methane is viewed as a waste gas and is frequently allowed to escape or in some cases flared off which is less harmful Unlike carbon dioxide emissions however which have been tracked in various ways since the 1950s emissions of methane are poorly understood and could represent a threat that scientists have still not accounted for,"[u'earth', u'technology', u'power', u'science', u'politics', u'carbon']","{207552: [2], 996616: [5, 5], 990217: [4], 113803: [3], 4312717: [2, 2, 2], 969998: [5, -2], 566160: [2, 2], 857617: [3], 1084567: [2], 524825: [2], 666: [3, 5], 682799: [5], 191260: [2], 1676552: [2], 265505: [2, -2], 321442: [2], 2678435: [2], 1040042: [5], 557867: [2, -2], 699308: [2, 2, -2], 195815: [2], 4765615: [2], 701233: [4, -2, 2, 2, 2, 3], 444210: [4], 1704630: [2], 79522: [3], 1525947: [3], 7485: [2, -2, 2, 2], 566974: [2, 2, 2, -2, -2, 2], 17472: [2, 2, 5], 641858: [2, -2, 2, -2, 2], 992580: [2], 858439: [3, 5], 127863: [2], 1040588: [2], 704461: [3, -2], 13261: [2, 5], 529617: [3], 635988: [2], 153816: [2, 2, 2, 2, -2], 2625839: [5], 3785311: [2], 2673597: [2, -2], 1976930: [2, 5, 3, 2], 840721: [3, 2], 638312: [2, 3, 2], 2423402: [3], 2968043: [2], 1167213: [2], 621550: [2], 884157: [5], 535155: [5], 184564: [2, 2], 588405: [2], 302582: [4], 230135: [2], 891256: [4, 2], 1036002: [5], 110975: [2], 102527: [2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, -2, 2]}",114

1344,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard A little over a year ago it was big news that thousands of people and hundreds of institutions controlling more than 26 trillion in total assets had pledged to remove their investments from stocks mutual funds and bonds that invest in fossil fuel companies A year later that number has doubled  According to a report by DivestInvest  a philanthropy helping to lead the movement more than 688 institutions and 60000 individual investors worth 52 trillion have pulled their investments from fossil fuel companies and have reinvested a portion of their assets into clean energy companies In September 2015 436 institutions and 2040 individuals worth 26 trillion had divested For comparison the total net worth of investors who had pulled out of the fossil fuel market was just 52 billion in September 2014 Divestment is increasingly seen as one of the stronger moves that private citizens and companies can take to support the move to clean energy The movement started in earnest in 2011 when college students began petitioning their institutions to remove their assets from stocks bonds and mutual funds that invest in fossil fuel companies What was seen as a gimmick at the time appears to be gaining real momentum a year after the Paris Climate Treaty was signed ,"[u'business', u'technology', u'power', u'money', u'science', u'hardware', u'fossil']","{22272: [2], 521345: [2, 2], 2189826: [2], 181252: [3], 736903: [2, 2], 1045640: [2], 990217: [4, 2], 1038732: [2, 2], 264592: [3], 840721: [3, 2, -2, 2], 655250: [2], 8103: [3], 1084567: [3], 1241496: [5, 2, -2, 2, 5, -2, 4, 2, 2, 2], 666: [2, 3, 2, 2], 966895: [2], 3678879: [3], 899105: [2], 2814641: [2], 756137: [2], 243626: [4, -2], 175943: [2, -2], 701917: [2], 1903280: [3], 2201864: [2], 652467: [2], 559668: [2, -2, 2], 948: [4], 664763: [4, -2, 2], 446269: [2], 658626: [3, 2, -2, 2, 3], 1098563: [2], 119237: [2, 2, -2, 2, -2], 664417: [2], 25929: [2, 2, 2, 5], 607946: [5, -2, -2], 729550: [2, 3], 529617: [3], 824291: [3, -2, -2, 3, -2, -2, 5, 5, -2], 582871: [3, -2], 544140: [3], 875483: [2, 3], 142940: [3, 2, -2, 3, 2, 4, 2, -2, 2, -2], 596061: [3], 4394035: [2, 2], 82658: [4], 965947: [2, 2], 1014225: [2], 173770: [3], 2968043: [3], 704621: [4], 49134: [4], 25149: [2], 184564: [2, 2], 2726007: [3], 891256: [2, 2, -2, 2], 731260: [2], 30335: [3, -2]}",123

3115,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from Electronic Frontier Foundation No one should have to fear losing their internet connection because of unfounded accusations But some rights holders want to use copyright law to force your Internet service provider ISP to cut off your access whenever they say so and in a case the Washington Post called  the copyright case that should worry all Internet providers  theyre hoping the courts will help them We first wrote about this case  BMG v Cox Communications  when it was filed back in 2014 and last month EFF Public Knowledge PK and the Center for Democracy and Technology CDT urged the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to overturn a ruling that ISP Cox Communications was liable for copyright infringement EFF PK and CDT advised the court to consider the importance of Internet access in daily life in determining when copyright law requires an ISP to cut off someones Internet subscription  The case turns in part on a provision in copyright law that gives internet intermediaries a safe harbor  legal protection against some copyright infringement lawsuits  provided they follow certain procedures Online platforms like Facebook and YouTube along with other internet intermediaries have to reasonably implement a policy for terminating subscribers and account holders that are repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances But given the importance of Internet access the circumstances where its appropriate to cut off a home Internet subscription entirely are few and far between The law as written is flexible enough that providers can design and implement policies that make sense for the nature of their service and their subscribers circumstances A repeat infringer policy for the company that provides your link to the Internet as a whole should take into account the essential nature of internet access and the severe harm caused by disconnection But music publisher BMG wants to use this provision to force ISPs to become tougher enforcers of copyright law According to BMG ISPs should be required both to forward rights holders threatening demand letters to their subscribers and terminate a subscribers Internet access whenever rights holders allege that person has repeatedly violated copyright law A subscriber is a repeat infringer and subject to termination they argue whenever they say so Coxs appeal of the ruling raises two very important issues 1 Who should be considered  a repeat infringer who should be cut off from the Internet  and 2 whether ISPs must either cede to rights holders demands or monitor their subscribers internet habits to avoid liability Slashdot reader waspleg adds Two landmark Supreme Court cases MetroGoldwynMayer Studios Inc v Grokster Ltd  and Sony Corp of America v Universal Studios made clear that if a service is capable of significant lawful uses and the provider doesnt actively encourage users to commit copyright infringement the provider shouldnt be held responsible when someone nonetheless uses the service unlawfully,"[u'yro', u'court', u'internet', u'communications', u'music', u'eff', u'networking', u'technology', u'network', u'entertainment']","{557057: [4], 139780: [2], 632203: [3, 2], 922765: [1], 2483988: [3], 692889: [4], 666: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0], 196126: [3, 3, 2], 3678879: [2, 5, 2], 892839: [2], 971949: [2], 1483695: [2, 2], 647217: [2, 4], 682162: [2, 1], 1418697: [3], 234313: [2, 3], 1153867: [2, 2], 1279820: [2], 836562: [2], 4603733: [1], 1118935: [5], 3654617: [2], 701917: [5], 2905315: [3, 2, 2], 637158: [2], 980074: [5], 151149: [3, 2], 871664: [2], 1040588: [2], 642677: [2], 54142: [5], 140799: [2]}",88

2210,BeauHD,An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer For the past two months a new exploit kit has been serving malicious code hidden in the pixels of banner ads via a malvertising campaign that has been active on several high profile websites Discovered by security researchers from ESET  this new exploit kit is named Stegano from the word steganography  which is a technique of hiding content inside other files In this particular scenario malvertising campaign operators hid malicious code inside PNG images used for banner ads The crooks took a PNG image and altered the transparency value of several pixels They then packed the modified image as an ad for which they bought ad displays on several highprofile websites Since a large number of advertising networks allow advertisers to deliver JavaScript code with their ads the crooks also included JS code that would parse the image extract the pixel transparency values and using a mathematical formula convert those values into a character Since images have millions of pixels crooks had all the space they needed to pack malicious code inside a PNG photo When extracted this malicious code would redirect the user to an intermediary ULR called gate where the host server would filter users This server would only accept connections from Internet Explorer users The reason is that the gate would exploit the CVE20160162 vulnerability that allowed the crooks to determine if the connection came from a real user or a reverse analysis system employed by security researchers Additionally this IE exploit also allowed the gate server to detect the presence of antivirus software In this case the server would drop the connection just to avoid exposing its infrastructure and trigger a warning that would alert both the user and the security firm If the gate server deemed the target valuable then it would redirect the user to the final stage which was the exploit kit itself hosted on another URL The Stegano exploit kit would use three Adobe Flash vulnerabilities CVE20158651 CVE20161019 or CVE20164117 to attack the users PC and forcibly download and launch into execution various strains of malware,"[u'software', u'privacy', u'internet', u'advertising', u'technology', u'java', u'security', u'it', u'malware']","{613215: [2], 1673220: [1, 1, 5, -2, 0, -2, 3, 1], 523990: [2], 666887: [1], 1955220: [5], 864651: [3, -2], 841228: [5, 2, -2], 1829006: [2], 937105: [2], 537106: [2], 241428: [2, -2], 1001493: [3], 4782965: [1], 1957016: [2, -2], 181252: [2, 2], 666: [1, 3, -2, 0, 1, -2, 2, 1, -2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], 831517: [1], 3678879: [2], 899105: [2, -2], 79522: [2], 19622: [2], 1040042: [3, 2, 2], 1950578: [2], 14640: [2, -2, 2], 1472499: [2], 4784565: [1], 4794043: [1, 1, -2], 326346: [2], 2538558: [2], 757109: [1, 1, 1, 1, -2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 14022: [5, 3], 774728: [2, 2], 607946: [2], 4621901: [2], 664142: [2], 2378710: [2], 153816: [2, -2, -2, 2, -2, 2], 312804: [3], 4502517: [2, -2, -2], 537183: [2], 4539195: [1], 195300: [2, -2, 2, 2, -2], 980074: [2], 67820: [5], 1292526: [2, -2, 2], 1152367: [2], 635504: [1], 132337: [3, 2, -2], 366322: [2, -2], 727027: [2], 840436: [2], 636021: [2, -2], 14070: [2, -2], 1354233: [2, 2], 30335: [2]}",125

1799,,Coisiche found a disturbing article from The Register about the UKs new Snoopers Charter law that has implications for tech companies around the world Among the many unpleasant things in the Investigatory Powers Act that was officially signed into law this week one that has not gained as much attention is the apparent ability for the UK government to undermine encryption and demand surveillance backdoors   As per the final wording of the law comms providers on the receiving end of a technical capacity notice will be obliged to do various things on demand for government snoops  such as disclosing details of any system upgrades and removing electronic protection on encrypted communications Thus by technical capability the government really means backdoors and deliberate security weaknesses so citizens encrypted online activities can be intercepted deciphered and monitored  At the end of the day will the UK security services be able to read your email your messages your posts and private tweets and your communications if they believe you pose a threat to national security Yes they will The bill added the Secretaries of State as a required signatory to the technical capacity notices which introduces a minor chokepoint and a degree of accountability But the article argues the law ultimately anticipates the breaking of encryption and without customer notification  The UK government can certainly insist that a company not based in the UK carry out its orders  that situation is specifically included in the new law  but as to whether it can realistically impose such a requirement well that will come down to how far those companies are willing to push back and how much they are willing to walk away from the UK market,"[u'uk', u'privacy', u'government', u'encryption', u'news', u'security']","{103170: [2], 1673220: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2], 3381765: [3], 1551067: [4], 736903: [2, 5], 674572: [2], 159117: [4, 3], 1829006: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2], 566799: [2], 589072: [2, 3], 4795025: [1], 721219: [5], 1001493: [5, 2, 2, 2], 915608: [3, 5, 2], 666: [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, -2, -2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], 136859: [2], 2972: [4], 196126: [3], 15173: [2, 2, 2, -2, 3], 762272: [5], 4753443: [1], 112805: [2], 259622: [3], 892839: [3, -2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2], 912399: [1], 1609333: [2], 710327: [2], 4780959: [5], 4508093: [2], 757109: [5], 4776131: [2, 2], 121541: [2, 2], 911942: [5], 143330: [3], 664142: [2], 151149: [2], 64210: [2, 2, 2], 464142: [2, 2], 987: [4], 3503967: [3], 659168: [4], 222434: [4, 2, -2], 31079: [5, -2], 949458: [2, 3], 624750: [2], 15477: [2], 1248758: [3], 216955: [2, 2]}",106

1938,BeauHD,A condition called visual impairment inter cranial pressure syndrome VIIP that has been impairing astronauts vision on the International Space Station is believed to be caused by a build up of cerebrospinal fluid CSF in their brains  The longduration astronauts had significantly more CSF in their brains than the shorttrip astronauts Previously NASA suspected that the condition was caused by the lack of gravity in space Science Alert reports The researchers compared before and after brain scans from seven astronauts who had spent many months in the ISS and compared them to nine astronauts who had just made short trips to and from the US space shuttle which was decommissioned in 2011 The one big difference between the two was that the longduration astronauts had significantly more cerebrospinal fluid CSF in their brains than the shorttrip astronauts and the researchers say this  not vascular fluid  is the cause of the vision loss Under normal circumstances CSF is important for cushioning the brain and spinal cord while also distributing nutrients around the body and helping to remove waste It can easily adjust to changes in pressure that our bodies experience when transitioning from lying down to sitting or standing but in the constant microgravity of space it starts to falter On earth the CSF system is built to accommodate these pressure changes but in space the system is confused by the lack of the posturerelated pressure changes says one of the team Noam Alperin  Based on the highresolution orbit and brain MRI scans taken of their 16 astronauts the team found that the longduration astronauts had far higher orbital CSF volume  CSF pooling around the optic nerves in the part of the skull that holds the eye They also had significantly higher ventricular CSF volume which means they had more CSF accumulating in the cavities of the brain where the fluid is produced,"[u'space', u'medicine', u'nasa', u'earth', u'technology', u'iss', u'transportation', u'science', u'health']","{573697: [1], 3156611: [1], 736903: [2, 2], 43274: [2], 173966: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2], 1955220: [2, 2, 2], 697113: [0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2], 666: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 881307: [2], 265505: [2], 822962: [2], 1727936: [2], 1275204: [2, 2, 2], 102093: [2, 2], 871886: [2, 2], 957785: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 1155547: [2], 1536101: [3], 692585: [2], 2968043: [2], 4697329: [1], 575091: [3, 2, 2], 825081: [2], 4559995: [1]}",77

2404,BeauHD,Scientists at the University of Bristol have found a way to convert thousands of tons of nuclear waste into manmade diamond batteries that can generate a small electric current for thousands of years New Atlas reports How to dispose of nuclear waste is one of the great technical challenges of the 21st century The trouble is it usually turns out not to be so much a question of disposal as longterm storage Disposal therefore is more often a matter of keeping waste safe but being able to get at it later when needed One unexpected example of this is the Bristol teams work on a major source of nuclear waste from Britains aging Magnox reactors  which are now being decommissioned after over half a century of service These first generation reactors used graphite blocks as moderators to slow down neutrons to keep the nuclear fission process running but decades of exposure have left the UK with 104720 tons of graphite blocks that are now classed as nuclear waste because the radiation in the reactors changes some of the inert carbon in the blocks into radioactive carbon14 Carbon14 is a lowyield beta particle emitter that cant penetrate even a few centimeters of air but its still too dangerous to allow into the environment Instead of burying it the Bristol teams solution is to remove most of the c14 from the graphite blocks and turn it into electricitygenerating diamonds The nuclear diamond battery is based on the fact that when a manmade diamond is exposed to radiation it produces a small electric current According to the researchers this makes it possible to build a battery that has no moving parts gives off no emissions and is maintenancefree The Bristol researchers found that the carbon14 wasnt uniformly distributed in the Magnox blocks but is concentrated in the side closest to the uranium fuel rods To produce the batteries the blocks are heated to drive out the carbon14 from the radioactive end leaving the blocks much less radioactive than before c14 gas is then collected and using low pressures and high temperatures is turned into manmade diamonds Once formed the beta particles emitted by the c14 interact with the diamonds crystal lattice throwing off electrons and generating electricity The diamonds themselves are radioactive so they are given a second nonradioactive diamond coating to act as a radiation shield,"[u'technology', u'power', u'uk', u'science', u'storage', u'hardware']","{1625475: [2], 263556: [3], 2584709: [1], 864651: [2], 644621: [2], 207121: [2, 2, 2, 2, -2], 812306: [2, 2, 5], 953874: [2, 2], 1129753: [2], 666: [3, 1, 1, -2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 4], 160668: [2], 196126: [5, 2], 225541: [4], 899105: [3], 1443: [3], 652467: [5, -2, 2], 892839: [4], 550940: [2], 1952554: [2, -2], 598059: [2], 107550: [3], 260657: [2], 1232050: [2, 2, 3], 1375923: [5, -2, -2, -2], 1023413: [2, 2, -2, 2], 2295862: [2], 1528503: [1], 1096761: [5], 2726007: [3, 2], 798091: [2, 2], 1189693: [4, 2, 3], 722110: [2], 1613749: [4, 5], 643147: [2], 1275204: [3], 32582: [2], 774728: [3], 1592393: [2, -2], 1099: [3, 3, 2], 1040588: [2], 267989: [2], 4145623: [3], 153816: [3, 2, 2, 3, -2, 2, -2], 2592601: [2, -2], 2428506: [2], 1223518: [3, 2], 626655: [2, 2], 6370: [2], 20347: [2], 2212710: [2], 157158: [2], 572394: [2], 2968043: [5], 19371: [5, -2, 3], 1292526: [2], 121842: [3], 1070040: [2, -2], 309950: [5], 208937: [2], 112247: [2], 2717051: [3, 2], 2470890: [2, 5, -2], 1868030: [1]}",115

1896,BeauHD,A recent survey of over 2000 adults conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Dashlane a leader in online identity and password management found that nearly 40 percent of Americans would give up sex for an entire year if it meant theyd never have to worry about being hacked  Huffington Post reports 40 percent of people also said theyd give up their favorite food for one month in the name of peace of mind online If all of this sounds drastic the truth is that it probably is The single biggest thing people can do to help keep their online identity safe is probably the easiest  a solid password 10 years ago antivirus was the primary method of online security But since the Internet has left the desktop and is on laptops tablets and cell phones and since so many people now use the cloud for backing up their sensitive data following proper password protocol is critical Of course having a solid password doesnt do a lot of good if youre giving it out to people And nearly 50 of people have shared a password to an email account or to an account like Netflix with a friend or had a friend share theirs which is a surprisingly high number when you consider that 4 out of 10 people said that sharing an online social media password was more intimate than sex A look at the password habits of Americans showed that about 30 have used a pets name almost 25 have used a family members name 21 a birthday and 10 each have used an anniversary a sports team an address or a phone number So if you just know a few basic personal details about someone youve got a decent chance at cracking their password The study also revealed some interesting data in that younger Americans those age 18 to 34 who grew up online are far more trusting with passwords than older generations and  married people are less likely to part with passwords than single people,"[u'mobile', u'cellphones', u'software', u'privacy', u'internet', u'communications', u'hardware', u'networking', u'devices', u'network', u'security', u'yro', u'food']","{4684: [2], 2435074: [2], 1022085: [2], 736903: [2], 1673484: [3, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2, -2, 2, 2, 2], 1188877: [5, 2], 1290638: [2], 79039: [2], 2035478: [2, -2, -2], 9623: [2], 912422: [2], 27417: [2], 666: [2, 2], 1175323: [2], 191260: [2], 1787294: [2], 3678879: [2], 137803: [2], 586021: [2], 965286: [2, -2], 1319: [5], 260657: [2, 5, 3, 2], 559668: [2], 1114677: [2], 2295862: [4, 2, 2, 2, -2], 965947: [2], 2673597: [2, 2, 2], 722110: [2, -2], 1635263: [2], 2429386: [2], 641858: [2], 4107715: [5], 234436: [2], 812342: [2], 467017: [2, 2], 746570: [2], 2726007: [2, 2, 2, 5], 1040588: [2], 709838: [5, -2], 657549: [2], 567632: [2, 2, 2, -2, 2], 597075: [2], 1829006: [2], 4145623: [2], 153816: [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 2814641: [2], 1155547: [3], 866572: [2], 148191: [2, -2], 664417: [2, 2, 2, 4, 3], 1838434: [5], 749283: [2], 6757: [2], 701642: [3], 4512999: [2], 2968043: [2, 2, 2], 4580343: [5], 803437: [2, -2], 202222: [2], 4720957: [5, 5, -2], 1151731: [2], 1363959: [2], 4245243: [5], 975102: [3, -2]}",115
